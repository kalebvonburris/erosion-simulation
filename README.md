# Getting it Running

In order to build the application, you'll need Rust (see [rustup.rs](rustup.rs)).

From there, build the dynamic library for the Godot project by running the following command in the `rust` folder:

```console
cargo build --release
```

You should now be able to open the Godot project and run the simulation.
